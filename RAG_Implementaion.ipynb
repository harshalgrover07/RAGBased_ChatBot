      "Machine Learning is a system of computer algorithms that can learn from example through self -\n",

      " \n",
      "The breakthrough comes with the idea that a machine can singularly learn from the data (i.e., example) to \n",
      "produce accurate results. Machine learning is closely related to data mining and Bayesian predictive \n",
      "modeling. The machine receives data as input and uses an algorithm to formulate answers. \n",
      " \n",
      "A typical machine learning tasks are to provide a recommendation. For those who have a Netflix account, all \n",
      "recommendations of movies or series are based on the user's histori cal data. Tech companies are using \n",
      "unsupervised learning to improve the user experience with personalizing recommendation. \n",
      " \n",
      "Machine learning is also used for a variety of tasks like fraud detection, predictive maintenance, portfolio \n",
      "optimization, automatize task and so on. \n",

      "Machine Learning vs. Traditional Programming \n",

      "Traditional programming differs significantly from machine learning. In traditional programming, a \n",

      "Traditional Programming \n",
      "Machine learning is supposed to overcome this issue . The machine learns how the input and output data \n",
      "are correlated and it writes a rule. The programmers do not need to write new rules each time there is new \n",

      "Machine Learning \n",
      "How does Machine Learning Work? \n",
      "Machine learning is the brain where all the learning takes place. The way the machine learns is similar to \n",
      "the human being. Humans learn from experience. The more we know, the more easily we can predict. B y \n",
      "analogy, when we face an unknown situation, the likelihood of success is lower than the known situation. \n",
      "Machines are trained the same. To make an accurate prediction, the machine sees an example. When we \n",
      "give the machine a similar example, it can figure  out the outcome. However, like a human, if its feed a \n",
      "previously unseen example, the machine has difficulties to predict. \n",
      "The core objective of machine learning is the  learning and inference. First of all, the machine learns \n",
      "through the discovery of patte rns. This discovery is made thanks to the  data. One crucial part of the data \n",
      "scientist is to choose carefully which data to provide to the machine. The list of attributes used to solve a \n",
      "problem is called a  feature vector. You can think of a feature vector  as a subset of data that is used to \n",
      "tackle a problem. \n",
      "The machine uses some fancy algorithms to simplify the reality and transform this discovery into a  model. \n",
      "Therefore, the learning stage is used to describe the data and summarize it into a model. \n",

      "recommended places you made. The place with the highest number of votes will be your final choice for the \n",
      "trip. \n",
      " \n",

      "It technically is an ensemble method (based on the divide -and-conquer approach) of decision trees \n",

      " The algorithm can be used in both classification and regression problems. \n",
      " Random forests can also handle missing values. There  are two ways to handle these: using median \n",

The project's abstract, introduction, aim, and scope are documented. The project utilizes Unified Modeling Language (UML) for modeling and describes a process involving input data, preprocessing, feature extraction, training, and prediction/classification of crime incidents. The primary goals of the UML design, relevant to this project, include providing an expressive visual modeling language, extendibility, and independence from specific programming languages and development processes.\n"
